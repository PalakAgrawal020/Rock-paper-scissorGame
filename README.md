# Rock-paper-scissorGame
It is a simple Rock Paper Scissor Game built in JavaScipt from scratch

I have created a game which you can play from console. 
It is a simple JavaScript implementation.
It takes a random selection from the computer and from the player and declares the result as the player chooses either 
rock paper or scissors.
